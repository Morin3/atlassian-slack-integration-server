HELP_TEXT="This is a shortcut script to run *everything* you need related to the Confluence plugin.

Arguments:
  - run       compile the common module, the Confluence plugin, and start up Confluence for development
  - pack      compile the Confluence plugin ('pack' is skipped if 'run' is passed)
  - common    compile common module
  - clean     clear compiled files, except Confluence home directory ('clean' is skipped if 'purge' is passed)
  - purge     clear all compiled files, including Confluence home directory with database and everything
  - deps      clean the plugin's embedded dependencies, forcing them to be rebuild in the next compilation
              (use when strange errors about missing classes occur - IntelliJ removes some files when rebuilding)

You pass any combination of arguments in any order. Calling the script without arguments defaults to: 'common confluence'

Examples:
  ./confluence.sh run          -> compiles the Confluence plugin and starts up Confluence for development

  ./confluence.sh              -> compiles the common module and the Confluence plugin; good for quick reloading
  ./confluence.sh common pack  -> same as above

  ./confluence.sh clean run    -> cleans all compiled files but the Confluence home directory, compiles everything, and runs Confluence in development mode
